# networks_project
Final project for 21D009 - Networks: Concepts and Algorithms

FYI
The [testing_rig.ipynb](https://github.com/DanJar96/networks_project/blob/main/testing_rig.ipynb) notebook is an example of how one can run simulations using a network structure of ones own liking.
The [utils.py](https://github.com/DanJar96/networks_project/blob/main/utils.py) file contains all the function used in the project.
